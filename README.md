# Python library to parse Altium files #

Published under the terms and conditions of GNU Affero GPL v3 license

## Dependencies ##

* Python 3, from <https://www.python.org/>
* The OleFileIO library. Either version 0.30 of the OleFileIO_PL fork, from
    <http://www.decalage.info/python/olefileio>, or version 2.4 of the Pillow
    fork, from <http://python-pillow.github.io/>. The PL fork would be
    simpler to install, but Pillow is probably more widely used.

## Usage ##

```shell
./parse-PcbLib.py My.PcbLib
```
